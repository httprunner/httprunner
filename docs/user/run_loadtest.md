# Run load test

> Integrated since HttpRunner 3.1.0

With reuse of [`Locust`][Locust], you can run load test without extra work.

```text
$ locusts -V                                                                 
locust 1.0.3
```

For full usage, you can run `locusts -h` to see help, and you will find that it is the same with `locust -h`.

The only difference is the `-f/--locustfile` argument. When you specify `-f` with a YAML/JSON testcase file, it will convert to pytest first and then run load test with HttpRunner's builtin locustfile(httprunner/ext/locust/locustfile.py).

```text
$ locusts -f examples/postman_echo/request_methods/request_with_variables.yml

```

In this case, you can reuse all features of [`Locust`][Locust].

```text
$ locusts -h

Master options:
  Options for running a Locust Master node when running Locust distributed. A Master node need Worker nodes that connect to it before it can run load tests.

  --master              Set locust to run in distributed mode with this
                        process as master
  --master-bind-host MASTER_BIND_HOST
                        Interfaces (hostname, ip) that locust master should
                        bind to. Only used when running with --master.
                        Defaults to * (all available interfaces).
  --master-bind-port MASTER_BIND_PORT
                        Port that locust master should bind to. Only used when
                        running with --master. Defaults to 5557.
  --expect-workers EXPECT_WORKERS
                        How many workers master should expect to connect
                        before starting the test (only when --headless used).

Worker options:
  
  Options for running a Locust Worker node when running Locust distributed. 
  Only the LOCUSTFILE (-f option) need to be specified when starting a Worker, since other options such as -u, -r, -t are specified on the Master node.

  --worker              Set locust to run in distributed mode with this
                        process as worker
  --master-host MASTER_HOST
                        Host or IP address of locust master for distributed
                        load testing. Only used when running with --worker.
                        Defaults to 127.0.0.1.
  --master-port MASTER_PORT
                        The port to connect to that is used by the locust
                        master for distributed load testing. Only used when
                        running with --worker. Defaults to 5557.

Tag options:
  Locust tasks can be tagged using the @tag decorator. These options let specify which tasks to include or exclude during a test.

  -T [TAG [TAG ...]], --tags [TAG [TAG ...]]
                        List of tags to include in the test, so only tasks
                        with any matching tags will be executed
  -E [TAG [TAG ...]], --exclude-tags [TAG [TAG ...]]
                        List of tags to exclude from the test, so only tasks
                        with no matching tags will be executed

Request statistics options:
  --csv CSV_PREFIX      Store current request stats to files in CSV format.
                        Setting this option will generate three files:
                        [CSV_PREFIX]_stats.csv, [CSV_PREFIX]_stats_history.csv
                        and [CSV_PREFIX]_failures.csv
  --csv-full-history    Store each stats entry in CSV format to
                        _stats_history.csv file
  --print-stats         Print stats in the console
  --only-summary        Only print the summary stats
  --reset-stats         Reset statistics once hatching has been completed.
                        Should be set on both master and workers when running
                        in distributed mode

Logging options:
  --skip-log-setup      Disable Locust's logging setup. Instead, the
                        configuration is provided by the Locust test or Python
                        defaults.
  --loglevel LOGLEVEL, -L LOGLEVEL
                        Choose between DEBUG/INFO/WARNING/ERROR/CRITICAL.
                        Default is INFO.
  --logfile LOGFILE     Path to log file. If not set, log will go to
                        stdout/stderr

Step load options:
  --step-load           Enable Step Load mode to monitor how performance
                        metrics varies when user load increases. Requires
                        --step-users and --step-time to be specified.
  --step-users STEP_USERS
                        User count to increase by step in Step Load mode. Only
                        used together with --step-load
  --step-time STEP_TIME
                        Step duration in Step Load mode, e.g. (300s, 20m, 3h,
                        1h30m, etc.). Only used together with --step-load

Other options:
  --show-task-ratio     Print table of the User classes' task execution ratio
  --show-task-ratio-json
                        Print json data of the User classes' task execution
                        ratio
  --version, -V         Show program's version number and exit
  --exit-code-on-error EXIT_CODE_ON_ERROR
                        Sets the process exit code to use when a test result
                        contain any failure or error
  -s STOP_TIMEOUT, --stop-timeout STOP_TIMEOUT
                        Number of seconds to wait for a simulated user to
                        complete any executing task before exiting. Default is
                        to terminate immediately. This parameter only needs to
                        be specified for the master process when running
                        Locust distributed.

User classes:
  UserClass             Optionally specify which User classes that should be
                        used (available User classes can be listed with -l or
                        --list)
```

Enjoy!
