# uixt

From v4.3.0ï¼ŒHttpRunner will support mobile UI automation testing:

- iOS: based on [appium/WebDriverAgent], with client library [electricbubble/gwda] in golang
- Android: based on UiAutomation

Some UI recognition algorithms are also introduced for both iOS and Android:

- OpenCV: based on [OpenCV 4], with golang bindings [hybridgroup/gocv] and helper utils [electricbubble/gwda-ext-opencv]
- OCR: based on OCR API service from [volcengine], other API service may be extended

## Dependencies

### OpenCV

[OpenCV 4] should be pre-installed.

You can install OpenCV 4.6.0 using Homebrew on macOS.

```bash
$ brew install opencv
```

You can get more installation introduction on [hybridgroup/gocv].

### OCR

OCR API is a paid service, you need to pre-purchase and configure the account key.

```bash
$ make build tags=ocr
```

## Thanks

This uixt module is initially forked from [electricbubble/gwda-ext-opencv] and made a lot of changes.
