> ⚠️ HttpRunner v5 only includes the Golang version, and the Python version of the code has been migrated to [httprunner/httprunner.py](https://github.com/httprunner/httprunner.py)

`HttpRunner` (also known as hrp) is an open-source testing framework that was born in 2017. Initially, it was used for API interface and performance testing, and later evolved into a versatile and extensible testing framework.

In 2022, HttpRunner began to support UI automation testing, currently supporting multiple system platforms such as Android/iOS/Harmony/Browser, and integrated large model technology in v5.

Compared to other UI automation frameworks, HttpRunner's main features include:

- Pure visual-driven solution (OCR/CV/LLM), pursuing universality and minimal performance loss
- Unified API across multiple platforms, reducing learning and horizontal expansion costs
- Embracing the open-source ecosystem, fully reusing open-source components
