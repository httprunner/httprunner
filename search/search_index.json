Notice, hrun is an command alias of httprunner run , they have the same effect. hrun = httprunner run run testcases in diverse ways \u00b6 HttpRunner can run testcases in diverse ways. You can run single testcase by specifying testcase file path. $ hrun path/to/testcase1 You can also run several testcases by specifying multiple testcase file paths. $ hrun path/to/testcase1 path/to/testcase2 If you want to run testcases of a whole project, you can achieve this goal by specifying the project folder path. $ hrun path/to/testcase_folder/ run YAML/JSON testcases \u00b6 If your testcases are written in YAML/JSON format, hrun will firstly convert YAML/JSON testcases to pytest(python) files, and run with pytest command. That is to say, hrun = make + pytest In most cases, the generated pytest files are in the same folder next to origin YAML/JSON files, with the same file name except adding _test suffix and replace extension .yml/yaml/.json with .py . /path/to/example.yml => /path/to/example_test.py However, if the testcase folder name or file name contains symbols like dot, hyphen or space, these symbols will be replaced with underscore in order to avoid syntax error in python class importing (testcase reference). Also, folder/file name starts with digit will be adding a prefix T because python module and class name can not be started with digit. path 1/a.b-2/3.yml => path_1/a_b_2/T3_test.py run pytest testcases \u00b6 If your testcases are written in pytest format, or you want to run pytest files converted from YAML/JSON testcases, hrun and pytest commands are both okay.

An expression is a python evaluatable expression where all names are substring-matched against test names and their parent classes. Example: -k 'test_method or test_other' matches all test functions and classes whose name contains 'test_method' or 'test_other', while -k 'not test_method' matches those that don't contain 'test_method' in their names. -k 'not test_method and not test_other' will eliminate the matches. Additionally keywords are matched to classes and functions containing extra names in their 'extra_keyword_matches' set, as well as functions which have names assigned directly to them. The matching is case-insensitive. -m MARKEXPR only run tests matching given mark expression. example: -m 'mark1 and not mark2'. --markers show markers (builtin, plugin and per-project ones). -x, --exitfirst exit instantly on first error or failed test. --maxfail=num exit after first num failures or errors. --strict-markers, --strict markers not registered in the `markers` section of the configuration file raise errors. -c file load configuration from `file` instead of trying to locate one of the implicit configuration files. --continue-on-collection-errors Force test execution even if collection errors occur. --rootdir=ROOTDIR Define root directory for tests.

An expression is a python evaluatable expression where all names are substring-matched against test names and their parent classes. Example: -k 'test_method or test_other' matches all test functions and classes whose name contains 'test_method' or 'test_other', while -k 'not test_method' matches those that don't contain 'test_method' in their names. -k 'not test_method and not test_other' will eliminate the matches. Additionally keywords are matched to classes and functions containing extra names in their 'extra_keyword_matches' set, as well as functions which have names assigned directly to them. The matching is case-insensitive. -m MARKEXPR only run tests matching given mark expression. example: -m 'mark1 and not mark2'. --markers show markers (builtin, plugin and per-project ones). -x, --exitfirst exit instantly on first error or failed test. --maxfail=num exit after first num failures or errors. --strict-markers, --strict markers not registered in the `markers` section of the configuration file raise errors. -c file load configuration from `file` instead of trying to locate one of the implicit configuration files. --continue-on-collection-errors Force test execution even if collection errors occur. --rootdir=ROOTDIR Define root directory for tests.

Besides, variables / extract / validate / hooks mechanisms are supported to create extremely complex test scenarios. from httprunner import HttpRunner , Config , Step , RunRequest , RunTestCase class TestCaseRequestWithFunctions ( HttpRunner ): config = ( Config ( \"request methods testcase with functions\" ) . variables ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"config_bar1\" , \"foo2\" : \"config_bar2\" , \"expect_foo1\" : \"config_bar1\" , \"expect_foo2\" : \"config_bar2\" , } ) . base_url ( \"https://postman-echo.com\" ) . verify ( False ) . export ( * [ \"foo3\" ]) ) teststeps = [ Step ( RunRequest ( \"get with params\" ) . with_variables ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"bar11\" , \"foo2\" : \"bar21\" , \"sum_v\" : \"${sum_two(1, 2)}\" } ) . get ( \"/get\" ) . with_params ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"$foo1\" , \"foo2\" : \"$foo2\" , \"sum_v\" : \"$sum_v\" }) . with_headers ( ** { \"User-Agent\" : \"HttpRunner/${get_httprunner_version()}\" }) . extract () . with_jmespath ( \"body.args.foo2\" , \"foo3\" ) . validate () . assert_equal ( \"status_code\" , 200 ) . assert_equal ( \"body.args.foo1\" , \"bar11\" ) . assert_equal ( \"body.args.sum_v\" , \"3\" ) . assert_equal ( \"body.args.foo2\" , \"bar21\" ) ), Step ( RunRequest ( \"post form data\" ) . with_variables ( ** { \"foo2\" : \"bar23\" }) . post ( \"/post\" ) . with_headers ( ** { \"User-Agent\" : \"HttpRunner/${get_httprunner_version()}\" , \"Content-Type\" : \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" , } ) . with_data ( \"foo1=$foo1&foo2=$foo2&foo3=$foo3\" ) . validate () . assert_equal ( \"status_code\" , 200 ) . assert_equal ( \"body.form.foo1\" , \"$expect_foo1\" ) . assert_equal ( \"body.form.foo2\" , \"bar23\" ) . assert_equal ( \"body.form.foo3\" , \"bar21\" ) ), ] if __name__ == \"__main__\" : TestCaseRequestWithFunctions () . test_start () chain call \u00b6 One of the most awesome features of HttpRunner v3.x is chain call , with which you do not need to remember any testcase format details and you can get intelligent completion when you write testcases in IDE. config \u00b6 Each testcase should have one config part, in which you can configure testcase level settings. name (required) \u00b6 Specify testcase name. This will be displayed in execution log and test report. base_url (optional) \u00b6 Specify common schema and host part of the SUT, e.g. https://postman-echo.com . If base_url is specified, url in teststep can only set relative path part. This is especially useful if you want to switch between different SUT environments. variables (optional) \u00b6 Specify common variables of testcase. Each teststep can reference config variable which is not set in step variables. In other words, step variables have higher priority than config variables. verify (optional) \u00b6 Specify whether to verify the server\u2019s TLS certificate. This is especially useful if we want to record HTTP traffic of testcase execution, because SSLError will be occurred if verify is not set or been set to True. SSLError(SSLCertVerificationError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed: self signed certificate in certificate chain (_ssl.c:1076)')) export (optional) \u00b6 Specify the exported session variables of testcase. Consider each testcase as a black box, config variables is the input part, and config export is the output part. In particular, when a testcase is referenced in another testcase's step, and will be extracted some session variables to be used in subsequent teststeps, then the extracted session variables should be configured in config export part. teststeps \u00b6 Each testcase should have one or multiple ordered test steps ( List[Step] ), each step is corresponding to a API request or another testcase reference call. Notice: The concept of API in HttpRunner v2.x has been deprecated for simplification. You can consider API as a testcase that has only one request step. RunRequest(name) \u00b6 RunRequest is used in a step to make request to API and do some extraction or validations for response. The argument name of RunRequest is used to specify teststep name, which will be displayed in execution log and test report. .with_variables \u00b6 Specify teststep variables. The variables of each step are independent, thus if you want to share variables in multiple steps, you should define variables in config variables. Besides, the step variables will override the ones that have the same name in config variables. .method(url) \u00b6 Specify HTTP method and the url of SUT. These are corresponding to method and url arguments of requests.request . If base_url is set in config, url can only set relative path part. .with_params \u00b6 Specify query string for the request url. This is corresponding to the params argument of requests.request . .with_headers \u00b6 Specify HTTP headers for the request. This is corresponding to the headers argument of requests.request . .with_cookies \u00b6 Specify HTTP request cookies. This is corresponding to the cookies argument of requests.request . .with_data \u00b6 Specify HTTP request body. This is corresponding to the data argument of requests.request . .with_json \u00b6 Specify HTTP request body in json. This is corresponding to the json argument of requests.request . extract \u00b6 .with_jmespath \u00b6 Extract JSON response body with jmespath . with_jmespath(jmes_path: Text, var_name: Text) jmes_path: jmespath expression, refer to JMESPath Tutorial for more details var_name: the variable name that stores extracted value, it can be referenced by subsequent test steps validate \u00b6 .assert_XXX \u00b6 Extract JSON response body with jmespath and validate with expected value. assert_XXX(jmes_path: Text, expected_value: Any, message: Text = \"\") jmes_path: jmespath expression, refer to JMESPath Tutorial for more details expected_value: the specified expected value, variable or function reference can also be used here message (optional): used to indicate assertion error reason The image below shows HttpRunner builtin validators. RunTestCase(name) \u00b6 RunTestCase is used in a step to reference another testcase call. The argument name of RunTestCase is used to specify teststep name, which will be displayed in execution log and test report. .with_variables \u00b6 Same with RunRequest's .with_variables . .call \u00b6 Specify referenced testcase class. .export \u00b6 Specify session variable names to export from referenced testcase. The exported variables can be referenced by subsequent test steps. import os import sys sys . path . insert ( 0 , os . getcwd ()) from httprunner import HttpRunner , Config , Step , RunRequest , RunTestCase from examples.postman_echo.request_methods.request_with_functions_test import ( TestCaseRequestWithFunctions as RequestWithFunctions , ) class TestCaseRequestWithTestcaseReference ( HttpRunner ): config = ( Config ( \"request methods testcase: reference testcase\" ) . variables ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"testsuite_config_bar1\" , \"expect_foo1\" : \"testsuite_config_bar1\" , \"expect_foo2\" : \"config_bar2\" , } ) . base_url ( \"https://postman-echo.com\" ) . verify ( False ) ) teststeps = [ Step ( RunTestCase ( \"request with functions\" ) . with_variables ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"testcase_ref_bar1\" , \"expect_foo1\" : \"testcase_ref_bar1\" } ) . call ( RequestWithFunctions ) . export ( * [ \"foo3\" ]) ), Step ( RunRequest ( \"post form data\" ) . with_variables ( ** { \"foo1\" : \"bar1\" }) . post ( \"/post\" ) . with_headers ( ** { \"User-Agent\" : \"HttpRunner/${get_httprunner_version()}\" , \"Content-Type\" : \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" , } ) . with_data ( \"foo1=$foo1&foo2=$foo3\" ) . validate () . assert_equal ( \"status_code\" , 200 ) . assert_equal ( \"body.form.foo1\" , \"bar1\" ) . assert_equal ( \"body.form.foo2\" , \"bar21\" ) ), ] if __name__ == \"__main__\" : TestCaseRequestWithTestcaseReference () . test_start ()","title":"Write Testcase"},{"location":"user/write_testcase/#write-testcase","text":"HttpRunner v3.x supports three testcase formats, pytest , YAML and JSON .
