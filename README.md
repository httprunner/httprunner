# HttpBoomer

> HttpBoomer = [HttpRunner] + [Boomer]

HttpBoomer is a golang implementation of [HttpRunner]. Ideally, HttpBoomer will be fully compatible with HttpRunner, including testcase format and usage. What's more, HttpBoomer will integrate Boomer natively to a better load generator for [locust].
